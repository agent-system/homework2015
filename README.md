This homework is for understanding a concept of Robot Architecture, and ROS(Robot Operating System).

Before doing this homework, you have to setup catkin ROS workspace for executing homework.

```bash
# install catkin tools
$ sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools python-rosdep ros-hydro-desktop-full
# create directory for workspace
$ mkdir -p $HOME/ros/hydro/src
$ cd $HOME/ros/hydro
# initialize workspace
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
$ catkin init
$ cd src
# put homework on your workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/agent-system/homework
$ cd ..
# install dependencies
$ sudo rosdep init
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
# build homework20150422 package
$ catkin build homework20150422
$ source $HOME/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash
$ echo 'source $HOME/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

Getting Started with Gazebo

launch gazebo with samplerobot
wget -q -O /tmp/jsk.rosbuild https://raw.github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_common/master/jsk.rosbuild
bash /tmp/jsk.rosbuild -s --rtm hydro
roslaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials gazebo_samplerobot_no_controllers.launch
rtmlaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials samplerobot_hrpsys_bringup.launch

with kinect
roscd hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials
git remote add furushchev https://github.com/furushchev/rtmros_tutorials.git
git checkout –b samplerobot-with-kinect furushchev/samplerobot-with-kinect
catkin bt

source ~/ros/hydro/devel/setup.bash
# terminal 1
roslaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials gazebo_samplerobot_no_controllers_drc_testbed.launch

# terminal 2
rtmlaunch hrpsys_gazebo_tutorials samplerobot_hrpsys_bringup.launch

# terminal 3
rosrun rviz rviz
# add RobotModel and PointCloud2 on rviz menu

# terminal 4
